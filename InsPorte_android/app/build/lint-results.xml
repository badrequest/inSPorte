        summary="Finds resource namespaces with hardcoded package names"
        explanation="In Gradle projects, the actual package used in the final APK can vary; for you can add a `.debug` package suffix in one version and not the other. Therefore, you should *not* hardcode the application package in the resource; instead, use the special namespace `http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto` which will cause the tools to figure out the right namespace for the resource regardless of the actual package used during the build."

        category="Security"

        summary="Ensure that allowBackup is explicitly set in the application&apos;s manifest"
        explanation="The allowBackup attribute determines if an application&apos;s data can be backed up and restored. It is documented at http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#allowBackup

By default, this flag is set to `true`. When this flag is set to `true`, application data can be backed up and restored by the user using `adb backup` and `adb restore`.

This may have security consequences for an application. `adb backup` allows users who have enabled USB debugging to copy application data off of the device. Once backed up, all application data can be read by the user. `adb restore` allows creation of application data from a source specified by the user. Following a restore, applications should not assume that the data, file permissions, and directory permissions were created by the application itself.

Setting `allowBackup=&quot;false&quot;` opts an application out of both backup and restore.

To fix this warning, decide whether your application should support backup, and explicitly set `android:allowBackup=(true|false)&quot;`"

* When creating configuration variations (for example for landscape or portrait)you have to repeat the actual text (and keep it up to date when making changes)

In Android Studio and Eclipse there are quickfixes to automatically extract this hardcoded string into a resource lookup."
